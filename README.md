# Week 5 Homework: Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## My Objective:
* Modify starter code to creat a simple calendar application that will allow users to save events for each hour of the day.

* Try to keep a clean look while styling the HMTL using CSS and JQuery.

* The calendar should be interactive and show past, present, and future time blocks by color.

* The curent day should be displayed at the top using moment.js.

* The info submitted in each time block should be stored in local storage and remain on the page when you refresh.
